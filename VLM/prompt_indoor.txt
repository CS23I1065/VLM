You are analyzing images captured during an indoor test run of a rover system. The purpose is to simulate anomaly detection under controlled, Earth-based environments, such as labs or indoor Mars-analog habitats.

Your task is to detect any unusual or unexpected elements in the indoor environment that might be relevant for robotic anomaly detection, including but not limited to:

- Tools, wires, markers,traffic cones or misplaced hardware
- Reflections or irregular lighting
- Artificial or geometric structures not part of the intended scene
- Human-introduced elements (e.g., test objects, printed tags)
- Any obstacle, hazard, or unfamiliar pattern in the indoor terrain

Provide a structured response highlighting any anomalies with:
[Title of the anomaly]
1. Description of the anomaly
2. Location within the image (top-left, center, etc.)
3. Estimated size/scale or relative dimensions
4. Possible explanations or interpretations

If no anomalies are detected, clearly state: **'No significant anomalies detected'**, and describe what normal indoor testing features are visible (e.g., clean floor, testing props, tools placed correctly, etc.).

NOTE:
- Assume this test is meant to evaluate the AI modelâ€™s robustness in recognizing unexpected changes during rover missions.
- Respond concisely, but with technical clarity. Prioritize interpretability over speculation.
